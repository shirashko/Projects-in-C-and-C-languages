### Project 1 - Caesar Cipher
This is the first exercise I have completed in Huji's Programming Workshop in C & C++ course.
The primary objective of this exercise is to provide the learner with a foundational understanding of the Caesar Cipher, as well as the fundamental principles of programming in the C language.
